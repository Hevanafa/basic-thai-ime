Basic Thai IME

How it works:
transcribe the word list while skipping all the diacritics,
then the user can search by how it's spelled

Examples:
Format:
[word]
[search term] instead of [how it's pronounced]

เขมร
"ekhmr" instead of "khamen"

ไวยากรณ์
"aiwyakrn" instead of "waiyakon"

วัฒนธรรม
"wthnthrrm" instead of "watthanatham"
